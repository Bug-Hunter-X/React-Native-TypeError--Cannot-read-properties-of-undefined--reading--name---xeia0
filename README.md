# React Native: Handling Asynchronous Data Fetching to Avoid 'Cannot read properties of undefined' Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications and provides a solution. The error, `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`, occurs when attempting to access properties of an object before it has been properly fetched or initialized. 

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, which attempts to access data from the state before it's populated from an asynchronous API call. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version that addresses this issue by conditionally rendering the component's content only after the data has been successfully fetched.
